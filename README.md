## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Web Development and here I will share all my projects.
- This is my first page here not very much info for now, but I am working on it and on some projects to be added here in the future :slightly_smiling_face:
- And now, while you wait, you can do some reading

# Earth facts
  
- âš¡Earth isn't actually round.
- âš¡Coral reefs are Earth's largest living structure.
- âš¡  Earth has a squishy interior.
- âš¡  Antarctica is home to the largest ice sheet on Earth.
- âš¡  The Moon is drifting away from Earth.
- âš¡   Atacama is the driest place on Earth. 
- âš¡  Earth's magnetic pole is creeping westward.
   
# Just a few Facts about Science:
- âš¡	The Speed of Light: Light travels at an incredible speed of approximately 299,792 kilometres per second. This means that light from the Sun takes just about 8 minutes and 20 seconds to reach Earth.
- âš¡	Human Brain Power: The human brain is a marvel of biology, containing approximately 86 billion neurons. It can generate about 20 watts of power, enough to power a small light bulb.
- âš¡	Water Composition: Water is essential for life, and itâ€™s made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom (H2O). Interestingly, water is the only substance that exists naturally in three states: solid, liquid, and gas.
- âš¡	DNA Length: If the DNA from a single human cell were stretched out, it would measure about 2 meters long. If all the DNA in your body were uncoiled, it would stretch to the sun and back several times.
- âš¡	Quantum Entanglement: Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon where particles become interconnected and the state of one instantly influences the state of another, no matter the distance between them. This concept challenges our understanding of space and time.
- âš¡	The Earthâ€™s Rotation: The Earth rotates at a speed of about 1670 kilometres per hour at the equator. Despite this high speed, we donâ€™t feel it due to the constant velocity and the gravitational pull keeping us grounded.
- âš¡	Black Holes: Black holes are regions in space where the gravitational pull is so strong that not even light can escape. The largest black hole discovered so far is TON 618, which has a mass 66 billion times that of our Sun.
- âš¡	The Human Body: The human body is composed of around 37.2 trillion cells. Each cell functions as a tiny factory, performing numerous complex processes to keep us alive.
- âš¡	Photosynthesis: Plants perform photosynthesis, a process that converts sunlight into energy. Amazingly, plants produce about 6.5 billion tons of oxygen each year through this process, which is essential for life on Earth.
- âš¡The Milky Way: Our galaxy, the Milky Way, is estimated to contain over 100 billion stars. Itâ€™s about 100,000 light-years in diameter and is just one of billions of galaxies in the universe.
